## About

Projects are a new way to manage your flow files. Rather than treat your flows as a simple pair of files, they represent everything you need to create a redistributable Ignite application.

They are backed by a Git repository, meaning all of the files are fully version controlled and allow developers to use familiar workflows to collaborate with others.
